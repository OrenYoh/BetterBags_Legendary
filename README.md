### Added a new language to support?

If you want your addon in your language you can open an issue / a PR. Otherwise, a "Localization" tab is available on Curse to translate. If you do, don't hesitate to ping me in the comments (I don't get notifications when new translations are added, and I sometimes forget to check).
